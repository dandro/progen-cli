# progen-cli
Cli tool for generating code for your project. The initial implementation will be based on React projects to generate most of the boilerplate code regular projects need.

*This tool doesn't do much at the moment.*

## Development
The project runs on Haskell GHC and has been setup with Stack version lts-13.29.
